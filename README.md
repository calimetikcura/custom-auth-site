# custom-auth-site

Customers can leverage Relativityâ€™s single sign-on capabilities to support custom authentication scenarios.  The idea is that a customer would build a custom OIDC external identity provider.  This custom OIDC provider would contain all of the custom logic necessary to authenticate the user.  Because Relativity supports SSO using OpenID Connect, customers can connect the custom identity provider to Relativity with no modification needed to the original Relativity project.
